/**
 * @dev Reference implementation for the base layer of a Pool contract that manages a single Pool with optional
 * Asset Managers, an admin-controlled swap fee percentage, and an emergency pause mechanism.
 *
 * Note that neither swap fees nor the pause mechanism are used by this contract. They are passed through so that
 * derived contracts can use them via the `_addSwapFeeAmount` and `_subtractSwapFeeAmount` functions, and the
 * `whenNotPaused` modifier.
 *
 * No admin permissions are checked here: instead, this contract delegates that to the Vault's own Authorizer.
 *
 * Because this contract doesn't implement the swap hooks, derived contracts should generally inherit from
 * BaseGeneralPool or BaseMinimalSwapInfoPool. Otherwise, subclasses must inherit from the corresponding interfaces
 * and implement the swap callbacks themselves.
